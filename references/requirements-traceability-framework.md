# Requirements Traceability Framework

## Purpose

This framework ensures technical implementation decisions are traceable back to business requirements, preventing scope misalignment and ensuring delivered functionality matches stakeholder expectations.

## Framework Components

### 1. Requirements Classification

**Categories:**
- **Functional Requirements (FR)** - What the system must do
- **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)** - How the system must perform
- **Integration Requirements (IR)** - How the system must connect with external systems
- **Evaluation Requirements (ER)** - How success will be measured

**Priority Levels:**
- **P0 (Critical)** - Must have for MVP
- **P1 (High)** - Should have for full functionality
- **P2 (Medium)** - Nice to have for enhanced experience
- **P3 (Low)** - Future consideration

### 2. Traceability Matrix Template

| Req ID | Category | Priority | Requirement Description | Technical Implementation | Status | Verification Method |
|--------|----------|----------|------------------------|-------------------------|---------|-------------------|
| FR-001 | Functional | P0 | Multi-strategy retrieval (BM25, vector, parent-doc, multi-query, rerank, ensemble) | RetrieverFactory with strategy plugins | Not Started | Unit tests + performance benchmarks |
| NFR-001 | Performance | P0 | Raw retrieval <2s, full answer <8s | Async implementation + caching | Not Started | Performance test suite |
| IR-001 | Integration | P0 | MCP dual interface (Tools + Resources) | FastMCP server with CQRS pattern | Not Started | Integration tests |
| ER-001 | Evaluation | P0 | RAGAS metrics (relevancy, precision, recall, faithfulness) | Evaluation harness with golden dataset | Not Started | Automated evaluation runs |

### 3. Requirements Validation Process

**Phase 1: Requirements Capture**
1. Read all requirements documentation (`INSTRUCTIONS.md`, specifications)
2. Identify and classify each requirement using the framework
3. Create initial traceability matrix
4. Validate understanding with stakeholder

**Phase 2: Technical Planning**
1. Map each requirement to technical implementation approach
2. Identify architectural decisions and dependencies
3. Estimate effort and complexity
4. Plan verification methods

**Phase 3: Implementation Tracking**
1. Update status as work progresses
2. Document technical decisions and trade-offs
3. Verify implementation meets requirements
4. Update matrix with actual vs planned approach

**Phase 4: Delivery Validation**
1. Execute verification methods for each requirement
2. Document gaps or deviations
3. Validate with stakeholder acceptance criteria
4. Plan remediation for any gaps

- ✅ Working research agent example

**Missing Critical Functionality:** ~85-90% of requirements
- ❌ Multi-strategy retrieval system (6 strategies)
- ❌ Evaluation framework (RAGAS integration)
- ❌ MCP Resources interface (CQRS pattern)
- ❌ Performance measurement and optimization
- ❌ Observability and tracing
- ❌ Comprehensive POC with golden dataset

## Implementation Guidelines

### Requirements Intake Process

**Before Starting Any Work:**
1. **Read Documentation:** Review all `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, specifications, and context
2. **Create Traceability Matrix:** Use template above to map all requirements
3. **Validate Scope:** Confirm understanding with stakeholder before implementation
4. **Plan Incrementally:** Break down into deliverable milestones
5. **Document Assumptions:** Capture any unclear or ambiguous requirements

### Technical Decision Documentation

**For Each Requirement:**
- **Implementation Approach:** How technically will this be solved?
- **Dependencies:** What other requirements or systems does this depend on?
- **Risk Assessment:** What could go wrong? What are the fallbacks?
- **Verification Plan:** How will we prove this requirement is met?
- **Acceptance Criteria:** What specific behavior demonstrates success?

### Status Tracking

**Status Definitions:**
- ❌ **Missing** - Not implemented
- 🟡 **Partial** - Partially implemented or needs enhancement
- ✅ **Complete** - Fully implemented and verified
- 🔍 **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- ⚠️ **Blocked** - Cannot proceed due to dependency or issue

### Change Management

**When Requirements Change:**
1. Update traceability matrix with new/modified requirements
2. Assess impact on existing implementation
3. Communicate scope/timeline implications
4. Get stakeholder approval for changes
5. Update technical plans and verification methods

## Success Metrics

### Process Metrics
- **Requirements Coverage:** % of identified requirements implemented
- **Scope Stability:** Number of requirements changes per week
- **Delivery Predictability:** Actual vs planned completion dates

### Quality Metrics
- **Requirement Verification:** % of requirements with passing verification tests

This framework ensures that technical work is always traceable back to business value and that scope gaps are identified early rather than discovered at delivery time.
